This is for the fantasy bachelor league. I'm not proud but here we are.


Things to do:

**Add "save partial" function
	*Make it so I can save my progress in case I need to fix something halfway through an episode, i don't have to end the program,
	*start over, and remember what all the scores were and all that. Sloppy, perhaps, but necessary for now I think

**Add "start new week" funciton
	*along the same lines, if I'm saving part way through weeks and stuff it would be nice to just hit a button and clear out everyone's
	*picks and such from last week so the system is started fresh and then I can do "set weekly picks" etc.

**Add "recieved rose" to contestants to make eliminations easier to do

**Add "report rose ceremony" funciton
	*these two go hand in hand. The rose ceremony happens fast. right now i have to hit like 4 buttons to enter one contestant
	*getting a rose. this would make it so I can do it all at the same time, hit done, and it will eliminate any contestant
	*who does not have "recieved rose" in one quick action. after eliminateing the players it can clear "recieved rose" for the next rose ceremony. Streamlining. Yeet.

**Add "report group date"
	*same idea. they say the names real fast. I don't want to have to go through each individual when I can just hit a button and it takes names until I say i'm done.
